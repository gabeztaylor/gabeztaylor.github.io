### 2/15/26

- **7:30 AM – 8:00 AM**: Relearned comparative advantage
  - **Sources**
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage
  - **Notes**
    - So the only reason this works is because of relative opportunity cost. Even if party A has an absolute advantage in efficiency over party B, paty A has an opportunity cost in choosing to spend time making something that they aren't **most** efficient at. Thus, they leave it to the scrubs to make that thing (even thought party A is better at it).

- **8:00 AM – 8:30 AM**: Continued learning transformers
  - **Sources**
    - Karpathy's tutorial on youtube
  - **Notes**
    - Biggest takeaway from this session was learning the difference between encoder and decoder, which he doesn't really explain until the end
