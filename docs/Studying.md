### 2/22/26 {#d-2-22-26}

- **12:55 PM – 3:00 PM** (2h 5m): More pde homework
  - **Notes**
    - Converting $$\int_{0}^t\int_{|\xi| = 1} f(x + s\xi) dS_{\xi} ds$$ to $$\int_{B_3(t)} \frac{f(y)}{|y|^2} dy$$ via $y = x + s\xi)$ took way too long. Basically, if you scale $\xi$ by $s$, you pick up an extra $s^2$ area. For fixed angles defining the area $dS_{\xi}$ at distance $1$ from the origin, when you scale the vector by $s$, each side length of $S_{\xi}$ gets scaled by $s$, so the total area is scaled by $s^2$.

### 2/21/26 {#d-2-21-26}

- **10:31 AM – 12:59 PM** (2h 28m): Asymptotics of rl paper
  - **Tags**
    - [#research](#tag-research)
    - [#rl](#tag-rl)
  - **Notes**
    - Sowers wanted me to walk him through the "various scales and how they interact". I translated this to roughly mean how the processes are coupled and what the convergence implications are. For example, since $h_t^N := Q_{\lfloor Nt \rfloor}^N$ it appears that letting $N \to \infty$ we would be taking infinitely many Q-learning steps. However, since we scale the output by $1\sqrt{N}$ and impose the learning rate to be $O(N^{-1})$, this amounts to making no parameter updates. So effectively, no learning is occurring even though the processes are coupled. However, once we obtain the limit $h_t$, training actually begins and converges to the Bellman solution as $t \to \infty$. I think this is roughly what we wants.

  - **Notes**
    - Mainly focused on overall proof flow. The trickiest step is the stochastic decomposition step where the martingale terms pop out.

- **9:30 AM – 11:00 AM** (1h 30m): Cleared Anki deck, roughly 250 cards.
  - **Notes**

### 2/15/26 {#d-2-15-26}

- **7:30 AM – 8:00 AM** (30m): Relearned comparative advantage
  - **Sources**
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage
  - **Notes**
    - So the only reason this works is because of relative opportunity cost. Even if party A has an absolute advantage in efficiency over party B, paty A has an opportunity cost in choosing to spend time making something that they aren't **most** efficient at. Thus, they leave it to the scrubs to make that thing (even thought party A is better at it).

- **8:00 AM – 8:30 AM** (30m): Continued learning transformers
  - **Sources**
    - Karpathy's tutorial on youtube
  - **Notes**
    - Biggest takeaway from this session was learning the difference between encoder and decoder, which he doesn't really explain until the end

- **8:28 AM – 9:13 AM** (45m): Built this app, made some git repos and pushed changes

- **9:18 AM – 12:42 PM** (3h 24m): Continued studying Asymptotics of RL paper
  - **Sources**
    - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07304
  - **Notes**
    - The measure for the weight distribution is frozen in time, but the solution still evolves in time. Roughly, the network is so wide that we're making tiny enough updates that the distribution doesn't change, but the accumulated changes over all weights is $$O(1)$$. The learning is driven from the kernel $$A$$ and the TD-error given from the environment. The network acts as like a fixed feature space instead of learning to represent new features.
