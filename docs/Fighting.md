### Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

I currently have my blue belt in BJJ, but I haven't trained consistently in about a year. Not sure how soon I'll get back to it, but the FOMO from seeing
old training partners getting promoted has grown to an uncomfortable level. [Here are some highlights](https://youtu.be/Hk4yjscElds) of my time competing in BJJ.

### Muay Thai

My current record in Muay Thai is 2-2 and I'm pretty sure it will stay that way until die. You can view one of my wins [here](https://youtu.be/vBENzHeO1E4) 
and one of my losses here.

### MMA

I have had two bouts under the [Caged Aggression Promotion](http://www.cagedaggressionevents.com/home.html). 
I barely won both of fights by clamping down a Kimura after getting my ass beat for the majority of the time spent in the octogon. You can watch the first one
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HS0-9Qrv-KE) and the second one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpsP5vWX2l8&t=631s).
