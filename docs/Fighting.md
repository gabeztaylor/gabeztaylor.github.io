### Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

> "You can't be full of shit and do Jiu Jitsu" - Joe Rogan

I currently have my blue belt in BJJ, but I haven't trained consistently in about a year. Not sure how soon I'll get back to it, but the FOMO from seeing
old training partners getting promoted has grown to an uncomfortable level.

### Muay Thai

> "Oh we're throwing spinning shit now?" - Nick Diaz

My current record in Muay Thai is 2-2 and I'm pretty sure it will stay that way until I die.

### MMA

> "Hey pussy, are you still there?" - Jon Jones

I have had two bouts under the [Caged Aggression Promotion](http://www.cagedaggressionevents.com/home.html). 
I barely won both of fights by clamping down a Kimura after getting my ass beat for the majority of the time spent in the octogon.
