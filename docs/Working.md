## MAGNet Project Summaries

I plan to add more detailed descriptions. 

### Automatic Refitting of Models (Summer 2020)

We demonstrated the benefits of automatically refitting under distributional shifts in the target and the features.

### Detection and Extraction of Feature Interactions (Fall 2020)

We developed a Python module that automatically detects and extracts feature interactions using spatial statistics and computer vision techniques.

### Recalibration of Neural Networks (Spring 2021)

We explored several recalibration methods that successfully reduce calibration error in Artifical Neural Network Classifiers without sacrificing the performance of the models.
