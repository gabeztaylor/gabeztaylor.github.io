I like studying the science of optimizing decisions under uncertainty. "Gabriel's Descent" is a play on words referencing the optimization algorithm Gradient Descent that is often used in Machine Learning, and a theological reference to the angel Gabriel's descent to the virgin Mary. The name attempts to capture an intersection of my interest in Computer Science, Statistics and Skepticism.
