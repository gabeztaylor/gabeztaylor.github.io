Today, we're doing two for one since they're both fairly straightforward.

### 2.2.5 - Real Analysis: Royden

By using properties of outer measure, prove that the interval $[0, 1]$ is not countable. 

***Proof:***

The outer measure of $[0, 1]$ is 1. Suppose that $[0, 1]$ is countable. We have that the outer measure of any countable set 0, and thus that contradicts  $m^*([0, 1]) = 1$, thus $[0, 1]$ is not countable.

### 2.2.6 - Real Analysis: Royden

Let $A$ be the set of irrational numbers in the interval $[0, 1]$. Prove that $m^*(A) = 1$. Note that $m^*$ denotes the **outer measure**. 

***Proof:***

First, note that 

$$A = [0, 1] \setminus (\mathbb{Q} \cap [0, 1])$$

Since $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, we have that $m^*(\mathbb{Q} \cap [0, 1]) = 0$. Hence,

$$
\begin{aligned}
m^*([0, 1]) &= m^*(A) + m^*(\mathbb{Q} \cap [0, 1]) \\
1 &= m^*(A)
\end{aligned}
$$
