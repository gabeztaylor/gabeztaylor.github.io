I just finished watching this video on youtube with 2.6 million views titled
"[how to master your emotions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGQQ7pJQqHk&t=433s)". Here are a few of the top comments:

Letter Flake says:

> My advice to people trying to master emotions: 
> 1. Donâ€™t ignore unpleasant or exciting emotions.
> 2. Understand their cause and source.
> 3. Decide if you want it to overtake you.

5 minute psychology says:

> Emotional intelligence has changed my life. For those who want to master their emotions:
> 1. Observe your emotions 
> 2. Analyse what causes them
> 3. Take 10 deep breaths before you react to something that makes you angry

Both of these people, while well intentioned, each provided two unneccesary and potentially harmful steps. They should have stopped at "Don't ignore 
unpleasant or exciting emotions" and "Observe your emotions". The next two steps are futile at best and exhausting at worst. Let's pick apart
**"Understand their cause and source"**. Yeah, good fucking luck buddy. Additionally, any attempt at fully understanding an unpleasant emotion
in the present moment will invariably be biased and may only capture a fraction of the truth. Subjectively, you don't know where your emotions come from. 
Understanding reactions and emotions is a practice for a later time.
 
Observing your emotions and controlling your emotions are two entirely, but subtly different things. Everyone knows and wants to control
their emotions. **That's the fucking problem.** Aiming to control emotions will only enrage the infuriated and dishearten
the dejected. You can't control your emotions. Not how you think you can. You can only get better at **detatching** from your emotions. 
Mastering emotions is the wrong message. 

I've said in a previous post to not be a slave to your emotions, and that might
seem to contradict what I'm saying here, however, ***not being a slave does not imply becoming the master***. 

Telling someone they can master their emotions is like telling your little brother he can play video games with you, and then handing him
a disconnected controller. You give him the illusion that he is playing, but in reality he has no fucking clue why Mario just fell
off rainbow road for a fifth time.
