I am beginning my PhD in Mathematics in Fall 2024 and one of the comprehensive required courses is [Real Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis). This course is historically one of the more difficult topics in one's PhD and thus I want to feel prepared going in. My goal is to post my solution to 100 exercises in Analysis from varying sources with special focus on [Measure Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)) and [Probability Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory). 


### Exercise 1 - [Analysis, Measure and Probability](http://euclid.trentu.ca/pivato/Teaching/measure.pdf)

The most conservative collection of 'manageable' sets is 

$$ \mathcal{M} = \{\{x\} ; x \in \mathbf{X} \}$$

the singleton subsets of $\mathbf{X}$. Let 

$$ \mathcal{C} := \{\mathbf{C} \subset \mathbf{X}; \text{either } \mathbf{C} \text{ is countable, or } \mathbf{X}\setminus \mathbf{C} \text{ is countable} \}$$

Show that $\mathcal{C} = \sigma(\mathcal{M})$, the sigma-algebra of countable and co-countable sets. 

***Proof:***

Let $A \in  \mathcal{C}$. Then, either $A \subset \mathbf{X}$ is countable or $\mathbf{X} \setminus A$ is countable. If $A$ is countable, then 

$$A = \bigcup_{x \in A} \{x\} \in \sigma(\mathcal{M})$$

since $\sigma(\mathcal{M})$ is closed under countable unions. If $A$ is not countable, then $\mathbf{X} \setminus A$ is countable. 

$$A = \bigcap_{x \in \mathbf{X} \setminus A} \mathbf{X} \setminus \{x\} \in \sigma(\mathcal{M})$$

since $\sigma(\mathcal{M})$ is closed under countable intersections. Hence, $ \mathcal{C} \subseteq \sigma( \mathcal{M})$. Next, suppose that $A \in \sigma(\mathcal{M})$. Then, there exists a countable number of subsets $U_n \subset \mathbf{X}$ such that

$$A = \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} U_n$$

but $U_n = \{x_n\}$ for some $x \in \mathbf{X}$. Hence, $A$ is countable and thus $\sigma(\mathcal{M}) \subseteq  \mathcal{C}$. Therefore, $ \mathcal{C} = \sigma( \mathcal{M})$.
