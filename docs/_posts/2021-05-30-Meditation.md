title: "Meditations on Meditation"

### Goal-less meditations
I often have to remind myself that there is no *goal* to meditation. Or, perhaps paradoxically the goal of meditation is merely noticing 
that it appears that I am in pursuit of some goal in meditating. Why do I even meditate in the first place? Clearly, I think that it will improve my life in some way, 
which implies that one day I might reach some goal of tranquility. However, the goal can be "achieved" right now in noticing that there is no *goal*, or final state of 
mind that I will embody. The *goal* simply is noticing in the moment that I am moved to meditate to pursue the *goal*. 

### Meta-meditations
In recent meditations, I find myself stuck in a seemingly "infinite" regress of noticing that I'm thinking, then noticing that I'm noticing that I'm thinking,
then noticing that I'm noticing I'm noticing that I'm thinking, and so on. Then I worry that meditation is pointless because I'll always be stuck in this loop of 
meta-meditation. However, this regress is quite obviously finite in nature. How many times can I actually notice that I'm noticing before they next thought of
judgment that I'm noticing that I'm noticing appears? Probably 3-5 times at most. Noticing that I'm noticing is perfectly normal. Noticing the judgement of 
noticing that I'm noticing is "normal". That is quite literally what meditation is. Just noticing whatever happens to appear, with no judgement. However, inevitably 
most thoughts provoke a judgement, but that *judgement is a thought itself* which can also be noticed *without judgement*. 

### Swiping right on short meditations
While I do enjoy the Waking Up app, and I do use guided meditations sometimes, the business model for Waking Up *should be in nature* similar to dating apps.
You use the app temporarily, *so that* one day you no longer have any use for the app. I also just suck at formal practice. The number of times I find myself lost 
in thought during a 10 minute guided meditation is embarrasing. What is far more useful for me, is super *short but frequent* meditations throughout the day. I'm 
talking 60 seconds at most, but maybe upwards of 100s of times throughout the day just notice "the contents of consciousness" that Sam loves to say. The contents
include thoughts in the mind *and* sensations in the body. The frequency is what's important.
