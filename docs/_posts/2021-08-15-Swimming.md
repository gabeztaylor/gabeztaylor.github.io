A person who is not a slave to their emotions can **minimize** the largest amount of subjective suffering and **maximize** the smallest amount of subjective well-being. 
Mediation is about severing the bond between the self and experienced emotion that has been reinforced through millions of years of evolution. 
**Meditation is about optimizing subjective experience.** 
What would your life be like if you were never affected by negative emotion again? That’s not to say you won’t experience negative emotion ever again, 
but what if you could reduce the effect size and shorten the time the negative emotion wielded power over you? I’m not just talking about anger or sadness, 
but also higher order emotions like jealousy and insecurity. On the other hand, what if you could amplify the effect size of positive emotion and lengthen 
the time your brain bathed in it? 

You are not your emotions, you are an ***observer*** of your emotions, whether you are paying attention or not.
Identifying with your emotions is like drowning in the shark tank at an aquarium instead of watching from the other side of the glass. 
The problem is that you are constantly being dropped back into the tank. Except you don’t always have to drown. 
You can learn to swim to the edge of the tank and climb down the ladder to watch the exhibit of emotions while sitting comfortably on the bench.
