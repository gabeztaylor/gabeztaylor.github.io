### 2.1.1 - Real Analysis: Royden

1. Let $m$ be a set function defined for all sets in a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ with values in $[0, \infty)$. Assume $m$ is countably additive over countable disjoint collections of sets in $\mathcal{A}$. Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are two sets in $\mathcal{A}$ with $A \subseteq B$, then $m(A) \leq m(B)$. This property is called *monotonicity*. 

***Proof:***

Note that 

$$B = A \; \dot \cup \; (B\setminus A)$$

and thus

$$m(B) = m(A) + m(B\setminus A) \geq m(A)$$
