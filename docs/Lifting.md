### Lifting in 2021

I plan to link my lifting journal spreadsheet. Right now my split consists of 2 days on 1 day off. Bench day coupled with rowing, followed by a squat day. 
I'm modulating my work capacity with 4 weeks of lower intensity and higher volume followed by 4 weeks of higher intesity and lower volume. 

### Current Numbers

Squat and Deadlift are likely to be higher because I haven't maxed out those lifts in 3 years. 

- Bench: 345
- Squat: 405 
- Deadlift: 455
