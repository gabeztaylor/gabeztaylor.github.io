### Lifting in 2021

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XI1Nc5aR5rGxZxPvZK1hB_FUt4B0UNe3vpiNrjCi_7s/edit?usp=sharing) is my lifting journal for 2021. In that spreadsheet, I only record bench and squat numbers, but I normally perform auxillary movements in addtion to benching and squatting, but I think its a little superfluous to track how many curls I'm doing lmao. 

Right now my split consists of 2 days on 1 day off. Bench day coupled with rowing, followed by a squat day. 
I'm modulating my work capacity with 4 weeks of lower intensity and higher volume followed by 4 weeks of higher intesity and lower volume. 

### Current Numbers

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10txtP7DMuuvLB9lMh8Mhv-jTf4FUJG3WVf2LLiVuEwg/edit?usp=sharing) are my current PR's. I'm slacking on squat because I'm a little jaded from the amount of squatting I did last summer.
