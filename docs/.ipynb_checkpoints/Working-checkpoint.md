## Programming Languages

I work every day in Python (for work & school) and R (for school). I'm normally lucky enough to program outside of SAS. 

### Python - Advanced

Common libraries I use:

- `pandas` for data wrangling
- `h2o` for lazy machien learning
- `numpy` for math operations 
- `scipy` for stats operations
- `sklearn` for lazy machine learning
- `Keras` for training neural nets
- `OpenCV` for computer vision
- `matplotlib` for plotting
- `seaborn` for prettier plotting
- `bokeh` for dashboards

### R - Advanced

Common libraries I use:

- `dplyr` for data wrangling
- `kableExtra` for sweet LATEX tables
- `ggplot2`for plotting
- `caret` for lazy machine learning
- `stringr` for string manipulation
- `shiny` for dashboards


## Intern Project Summaries

Below, I summarize projects I have completed at internships. 

### Claims Image Detection

- Labeled and trained Deep Learning Models on claims images using AWS Rekognition
    and Facebook's Detectron to expedite the storage and retrieval of claims images.

### Recalibration of Neural Networks

- Created Python package for popular recalibration methods for Artificial Neural
    Network Classifiers, such as Temperature Scaling, Dirichlet Calibration, and
    Maximum Mean Calibration Error within the Keras API framework.

- Demonstrated the perils of poorly-calibrated models, the benefits of well-calibrated models, and the effect of recalibrating on rank-ordering.

### Automatic Interaction Feature Detection and Extraction
- Developed a package in Python for automatic feature interaction and extraction using
    Riley's K Function, Maximum Absolute Deviation, Marching Squares Algorithm, and
    Morphological Transformations
    
- Given a binary target with continuous features, our module can detect pair-wise interactions and subsequently extract the specific nature of the interaction in order to encode the relationship into a model 

### Automatic Refitting of Models Under Data Drift

- Built a dynamic Bokeh dashboard in Python visualizing XGBoost model performance
    on claims data given a user-specified training and testing window for manual and
    automatically refitted models, and additionally, an interactive heat map depicting p-
    values from Chi-Square Tests in effort to visualize statistically significant distributional
    shift over time.
    
### Dynamic Binning Tool 

- Developed Exploratory Data Analysis tool in Python for manually binning rows

### Recreational Vehicle Rating

- Built Generalized Linear Models on 30 million rows of auto data in SAS in effort to
advise potential revision of current rating structure for recreational vehicles.

### Machine Learning Interpretation Methods

- Researched black-box machine learning interpretation methods, such as Shapley
Values and Partial Dependence, by implementing SAS action sets on a Gradient
Boosting Machines model.

### Alternative Linear Models

- Investigated and built alternative predictive models, such as Elastic Net and
Generalized Additive Models, in SAS on 60 million rows of homeowner data.

## Publication

Somehow I wrote a paper (along with a lot of help from people a lot smarter than me) about interpretable machine learning with implementations in SAS that got accpeted for the 2019 SAS global forum. If you really have nothing better to do, you can [read it here](https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/support/en/sas-global-forum-proceedings/2020/5116-2020.pdf) and the accompanying E-poster that exposes my lack of design talent [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yAAPK0YgsX-gb1ooGY5VBwnYg1Zt3Cpu/view?usp=sharing).
