# Books in 2021

### Reviews

I score the books based on the following criteria:

- **Difficulty (1 - 5)**: how much cognitive strain does the book demand? Can I read it before bed, or do I need to take a stimulant beforehand?  

- **Engagement (1 - 5)**: how well does the book hold my attention? Is the book a chore to get through, or do I have trouble putting it down?

- **Practicality (1 - 5)**: how useful are the lessons? Do they map onto daily life? Do they have the potential to change someone's life? 

I also provide my favorite chapters in case you want to jsut sample the book or don't want to commit to the entire book.

### Selfish Gene

**Takeaways**:

- Natural selection works at the level of the gene, **not** on populations, groups, or individuals. 

- Altruism is a result of natural selection favoring combinations of genes in individuals that may sacrifice themselves for the survival of the same genes
housed in other individuals. A common misconception is that the book claims all indivudals are selfish, which is a false claim. The **genes** in individuals are selfish, which explains how altrusim can arise in species. "I'll lay my life down for two brothers or eight cousins". 

- [Tit for tat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_Guys_Finish_First), also known as reciprocal altruism, is the best "life strategy". 
  
**Recommended Chapters**:

- The replicators
- Genesmanship
- Nice guys finish first

**Scores**:

- **Difficulty: 3**: This book is perfect for those who only have a base understanding of evolution and its mechanisms (like myself) who are searching
for a bit more explanations. However, Richard Dawkins presents the material in a very layman style, which also makes it great for those who have no 
scientific background at all. 

- **Engagement: 3**: On balance, the book kept my attention, but there are some chapters I could've done without. 
- **Practicality: 2** While the content is very interesting, I find that my life hasn't changed dramatically after reading, but I do have a more solid
understanding of genetics and evolution, which is helpful in some conversations.
