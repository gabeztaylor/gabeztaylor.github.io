# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Gabriel's Descent is a play on words referencing the optimization algorithm Gradient Descent that is often used in Machine Learning, and a 
  theological reference to the angel Gabriel's descent to the virgin Mary. The name attempts to capture an intersection of my interest in Computer Science,
  Statistics and Skepticism.
