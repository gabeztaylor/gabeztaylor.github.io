        "Sowers wanted me to walk him through the \"various scales and how they interact\". I translated this to roughly mean how the processes are coupled and what the convergence implications are. For example, since $h_t^N := Q_{\\lfloor Nt \\rfloor}^N$ it appears that letting $N \\to \\infty$ we would be taking infinitely many Q-learning steps. However, since we scale the output by $1\\sqrt{N}$ and impose the learning rate to be $O(N^{-1})$, this amounts to making no parameter updates. So effectively, no learning is occurring even though the processes are coupled. However, once we obtain the limit $h_t$, training actually begins and converges to the Bellman solution as $t \\to \\infty$. I think this is roughly what we wants."
