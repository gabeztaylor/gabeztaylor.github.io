        "Converting $$\\int_{0}^t\\int_{|\\xi| = 1} f(x + s\\xi) dS_{\\xi} ds$$ to $$\\int_{B_3(t)} \\frac{f(y)}{|y|^2} dy$$ via $y = x + s\\xi)$ took way too long. Basically, if you scale $\\xi$ by $s$, you pick up an extra $s^2$ area. For fixed angles defining the area $dS_{\\xi}$ at distance $1$ from the origin, when you scale the vector by $s$, each side length of $S_{\\xi}$ gets scaled by $s$, so the total area is scaled by $s^2$."
