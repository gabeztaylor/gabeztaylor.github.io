## You Probably Don't Have Free Will

> "Why aren't you more interested in rocks?" - Sam Harris

Consider the following experiment that you can do right now:

1. Without using a random generator or anything other than your brain, write down a number between 1 and 1,000,000.
2. Now write down a different number.
3. Ok, one more time; Write down a different number.

What was that process like? Why did you choose those numbers? Why didn't you choose 69, 258, and 784,532? You know those numbers exist, but they probably just didn't
occur to you to pick them. Are you then ***free*** to choose that which does not occur to you? This is almost an exact replica of the experiment [Sam Harris](https://samharris.org/)
usually conducts on audiences with movies and cities in liue of numbers, of which you are free to use and repeat the experiment.

## You're Probably Not Going To Heaven (or Hell). 

> “Properly read, the Bible is the most potent force for atheism ever conceived.” - Isaac Asimov

Given the absence of free will there's probably no reason to believe in any religions founded in retribution and redemption. However, even if you're reluctant to accept 
that you are completely at the mercy of the laws of physics in which you exist, there is still not really any good reason to believe there's a god. I encourage you
to [browse this site](https://whynogod.wordpress.com/) if you consider yourself a theist. While it is not exhaustive, it at least has the potential to expose you 
to new thoughts. If anything, consider it a *test of faith* in which God would look upon you with delight as you brave the temptations of doubt.

My own deconversion started with the realization that the Bible is fallible and clearly man-made. [This is a beautiful dashboard](https://philb61.github.io/) visualizing the contradictions and moral atrocities of the bible.
